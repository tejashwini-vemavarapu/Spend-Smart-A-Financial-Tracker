# Finance Tracker – Machine Learning & Predictive Analytics


# Project Overview

The Personal Finance Tracker is a web-based application designed to help users monitor and analyze their spending patterns, categorize expenses, and forecast future expenditures. Leveraging machine learning and data visualization, this tool provides actionable insights for effective financial management.

# Features
Expense Tracking: Log daily expenses, categorize transactions, and generate monthly spending reports.
Predictive Analytics: Forecast monthly expenses using machine learning models, including linear regression, random forest, and gradient boosting.
Interactive Visualizations: Explore spending trends, payment modes, and seasonal patterns through Tableau dashboards for enhanced insights.

# Methodology
Data Collection: Gathered transaction data, including expense category, amount, date, and payment method.
Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, standardized categories, and ensured data consistency.
Data Processing: Prepared the cleaned data for analysis, organizing it for easy access in model building and visualization.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed spending trends, category distribution, seasonal patterns, and payment methods to gain insights.
Feature Engineering: Extracted new features (e.g., transaction time of day, monthly averages, recurring expenses) to improve model accuracy.
Modeling: Built and evaluated predictive models, including:
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor Each model was trained on historical data to forecast monthly expenses accurately.
Data Visualization: Created interactive dashboards in Tableau to visualize spending trends, expense categories, and seasonal insights.
Deployment: Set up the application to allow users to log expenses and access predictions and visual insights.

# Technologies Used
Python: For data processing, feature engineering, and machine learning.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
Tableau: For interactive dashboards and data visualization.
